# install git

Git is version control software you install on your machine. Once installed, we will access its functionality via the RStudio interface.  

- [Why Git? What is Git?](../resources/readings/2017-Bryan-Version-control) Read sections 1 and 2 for a good introduction to version control 

Jenny Bryan provided these instructions for a workshop I attended. I suggest you read all the instructions before starting. 

- [Git already installed?](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#git-already-installed) 
- [Windows](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows) install 
- [Mac OS](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#mac-os) install 
- [Linux](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#linux) install 

That's all for now. We'll do more with git when we work with GitHub.
