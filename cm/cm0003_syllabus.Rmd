## description  

ME497/ME597 Reproducible Research (4R-0L-4C). 

We explore the principles and practice of reproducible research by learning to organize a technical project for reproducibility from the beginning of the project and to explicitly link narrative and computing. The course takes you through a reproducible research workflow including collaboration and version control via GitHub. 

While the course has an ME prefix, no mechanical engineering bckground is required. Ths course is open to all majors, especially anyone interested in data science. 

The software environment is R & RStudio---no prior experience required.


## prerequisites

497: Junior standing    
597: Instructor permission required. Graduate students only with a project underway generating quantitative data.    



## instructor

Richard Layton, PhD    
Professor of Mechanical Engineering  
Moench Hall C--217  
layton@rose-hulman.edu  
812--877--8905  

## textbook

**Required text** (2017) Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, *R for Data Science*,  O'Reilly Media. [free e-copy online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This book is particularly useful for the R novice.

**Optional reference text** Christopher Gandrud, 2015, *Reproducible Research with R and RStudio, 2/e*, CRC Press. This book addresses our reproducibility topics in detail, making it a quite useful companion text.

## objectives

After successfully completing this course, students should be able to:

- Identify non-reproducible practices in a conventional workflow 
- Describe the problems that reproducibility helps solve 
- List the basic principles of reproducible research 
- Organize directories and files for reproducibility 
- Create reproducible reports using R and RStudio 
- Reproduce someone else's reproducible project 
- Implement version control using Git and GitHub 
 
## grades

Grades awarded are based on the [Institute standards](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/grades.html), for example, an "A" is an *honor grade*, a "B" is awarded for *thorough competence*, and a "C" indicates that *minimum standards have been met*. 

The major deliverables and their relative weights are: 

  
- (25%) Project 1: Recreating one's own prior report in reproducible form 
- (40%) Project 2: Major term-project in data gathering, data carpentry, analysis, and reporting 
- (25%) Cloning, reproducing, and evaluating someone else's project 
- (10%) Participation, readings, discussions 


## academic accommodations

I understand that "invisible" disabilities (learning and attention deficit disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, clinical depression, etc.) can significantly affect a student's academic performance.  I strongly encourage students to document special academic needs with staff at the Office of Student Affairs, and then to contact me as soon as possible so that we can work together to provide recommended academic accommodations while protecting your privacy.  It is the student's responsibility to request any approved, documented academic accommodations at least *one week* in advance of the event. 


## academic integrity

Do your own work. Write your own scripts. Every draft and every revision reflects your thinking.  

Collaboration is still encouraged. Doing your own work does not mean that you work in isolation.

- An ethical author can *discuss ideas* with others. An ethical author does not have to be a lone genius working in isolation. 
- An ethical author can use code fragments or design ideas from *credible external sources* such as R blogs, books, or class materials. The R community provides abundant help. 
- An ethical author can teach others and learn from others. Help a classmate debug their code, but *view their code only*. 



Avoid peer-to-peer plagiarism. Teaching and learning are not the same as showing and copying. 

Do not compare one another's code line by line, do not share your files, do not copy another's code fragments, and do not represent someone else's work as your own. All are academic misconduct.

``Rose-Hulman expects its students to be responsible adults and to behave at all times with honor and integrity.'' (RHIT Academic Rules and Procedures.)  It is my policy to follow the letter and intent of the Rules and Procedures regarding academic misconduct.    



## caveat

I reserve the right to modify the course content, schedule, policies, etc. outlined in this syllabus. I will do my best to give you adequate notice of revisions.
