# create a library for packages 

Packages are like "apps" for R. As Hadley states, "Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data." [@wickhamgrolemund2016] 

If we store packages in a library separate from the base R installation, then when you update R, you don't have to reinstall every package, saving a lot of time.

## assignment

At the top level of your drive, create a new directory (folder) named "R". In that directory create a new folder named "library", for example,

-   Windows: `C:/R/library`
-   Linux: `~/R/library`
