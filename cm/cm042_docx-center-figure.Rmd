# Rmd to docx: Centering figures and captions 

R Markdown does not have a native method for centering figures and captions in docx output. In this tutorial, I modify a predefined Word *style* to center figures and captions. 

## word styles 

In R Markdown, you control the formatting of a Word document output by modifying predefined Word styles. For more information on creating and editing the reference styles file generally, see my article [Happy collaboration with Rmd to docx](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html). 

For centering figures and captions, I suggest modifying the rarely used, predefined *Heading 6* style in the same way that Norbert Köhler, in his article [R Markdown: How to insert page breaks in a MS Word document](http://datascienceplus.com/r-markdown-how-to-insert-page-breaks-in-a-ms-word-document/), suggests dedicating the rarely used, predefined *Heading 5* style for inserting page breaks. 


## getting started  

Prepare the following files: 


- An image saved in PNG format or other docx-compatible format 
- A reference styles file, e.g., `my-styles.docx` 
- Your Rmd to docx script with the reference styles file specified in the YAML header, e.g., 

```
    ---
    output:
      word_document:
         reference_docx: my-styles.docx
    ---
```

## modify heading 6   

- Open the Rmd script  
- At the location where you wish to insert the image, type the 6 hashtags that indicate a level-6 heading, and repeat on the next line. 
- Add some temporary text, for example, 

```
    ###### the figure will go here 
    ###### the caption will go here
```

- Save and Knit 
- In the Word doc that appears, select the lines formatted with the Heading 6 style 
- Modify the style to be centered on the page 
- Modify the typeface as desired for figure captions 
- Save As the new version of the reference styles file,  `my-styles.docx` 
- Close the docx file 

## import the first image 

In the Rmd script, replace the two temporary lines: 

- heading-6, line 1, import the image 
- heading-6, line 2, the figure caption 

```
    ###### ![](my-image.png) 
    ###### Figure 1: Caption for my image 
```

- Save and Knit. 

## subsequent images  

For subsequent centered images, use the heading-6 markup again, e.g.,  

```
    ###### ![](my-next-image.png) 
    ###### Figure 2: Caption for my next image 
```
